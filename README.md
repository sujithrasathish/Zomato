Project Title : Zomato Data Analysis and Visualization
Skills take away From This Project : Python scripting, Pandas and Plotly
Domain : Data analysis and visualization



Problem Statement:
Zomato is a popular restaurant discovery and food delivery service. Data analysis on the platform's data could be used to gain insights into customer preferences and behavior, as well as identify trends in the restaurant industry. To perform the analysis various methodologies such as Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Selection And Deployment can be used. Additionally, various data visualization techniques like bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, etc. could be employed to help communicate the insights gained from the analysis.Overall, data visualization can be used to effectively communicate the insights from Zomato data analysis to a wide range of stakeholders, including restaurants, food industry players, and investors.

TASK 1: DATA ENGINEERING

1. Add a column with rupees as the currency
2 .Bring out a plot that compares indian currency with other country’s currency


TASK 2 : DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT

 	The Plotly or streamlit Dashboard that is being developed is  recommended to have the following: 


create a dropdown to choose the country-specific data
Any two charts of your choice(maybe count, total sales, favorite cuisines, etc)
Find which cuisines are costly in India
Filter based on the city
Which is famous cuisine in the city
Which is costlier cuisine
Rating count in the city (based on rating test)
Pie chart online delivery vs dine-in
Comparison between the cities in India(own report)
Which part of India spends more on online delivery
Which part of India spends more on dine-in
Which part has a high living cost  vs low living cost

TASK 3 : DASHBOARD DEPLOYMENT
Host and deploy the dashboard onto some web app server
Results: You have to build a Plotly Dashboard that helps to analyze and  improve zomato's business.
